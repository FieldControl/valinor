 * This uses a dynamic import to load a module which may be ESM.
 * CommonJS code can load ESM code via a dynamic import. Unfortunately, TypeScript
 * will currently, unconditionally downlevel dynamic import into a require call.
 * require calls cannot load ESM code and will result in a runtime error. To workaround
 * this, a Function constructor is used to prevent TypeScript from changing the dynamic import.
 * Once TypeScript provides support for keeping the dynamic import this workaround can
 * be dropped.
 *
 * @param modulePath The path of the module to load.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to the dynamically imported module.
