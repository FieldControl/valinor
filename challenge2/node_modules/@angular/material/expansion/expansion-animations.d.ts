/**
 * Animations used by the Material expansion panel.
 *
 * A bug in angular animation's `state` when ViewContainers are moved using ViewContainerRef.move()
 * causes the animation state of moved components to become `void` upon exit, and not update again
 * upon reentry into the DOM.  This can lead a to situation for the expansion panel where the state
 * of the panel is `expanded` or `collapsed` but the animation state is `void`.
 *
 * To correctly handle animating to the next state, we animate between `void` and `collapsed` which
 * are defined to have the same styles. Since angular animates from the current styles to the
 * destination state's style definition, in situations where we are moving from `void`'s styles to
 * `collapsed` this acts a noop since no style values change.
 *
 * In the case where angular's animation state is out of sync with the expansion panel's state, the
 * expansion panel being `expanded` and angular animations being `void`, the animation from the
 * `expanded`'s effective styles (though in a `void` animation state) to the collapsed state will
 * occur as expected.
 *
 * Angular Bug: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18847
