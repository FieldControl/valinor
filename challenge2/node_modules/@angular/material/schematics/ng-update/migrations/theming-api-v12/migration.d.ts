 * Migrates the content of a file to the new theming API. Note that this migration is using plain
 * string manipulation, rather than the AST from PostCSS and the schematics string manipulation
 * APIs, because it allows us to run it inside g3 and to avoid introducing new dependencies.
 * @param content Content of the file.
 * @param oldMaterialPrefix Prefix with which the old Material imports should start.
 *   Has to end with a slash. E.g. if `@import '~@angular/material/theming'` should be
 *   matched, the prefix would be `~@angular/material/`.
 * @param oldCdkPrefix Prefix with which the old CDK imports should start.
 *   Has to end with a slash. E.g. if `@import '~@angular/cdk/overlay'` should be
 *   matched, the prefix would be `~@angular/cdk/`.
 * @param newMaterialImportPath New import to the Material theming API (e.g. `~@angular/material`).
 * @param newCdkImportPath New import to the CDK Sass APIs (e.g. `~@angular/cdk`).
