 * state and undergoes transitions as compilation proceeds through the various steps.
 *
 * In practice, traits are instances of the private class `TraitImpl` declared below. Through the
 * various interfaces included in this union type, the legal API of a trait in any given state is
 * represented in the type system. This includes any possible transitions from one type to the next.
 *
 * This not only simplifies the implementation, but ensures traits are monomorphic objects as
 * they're all just "views" in the type system of the same object (which never changes shape).
