 * Patch `Event` instance during non-standard `Event` dispatch. This patches just the `Event`

 *
 * This is necessary because dispatching an `Event` outside of browser dispatch results in
 * incorrect properties and methods that need to be polyfilled or do not work.
 *
 * JSAction dispatch adds two extra "phases" to event dispatch:
 * 1. Event delegation - the event is being dispatched by a delegating event handler on a container
 *    (typically `window.document.documentElement`), to a delegated event handler on some child
 *    element. Certain `Event` properties will be unintuitive, such as `currentTarget`, which would
 *    be the container rather than the child element. Bubbling would also not work. In order to
 *    emulate the browser, these properties and methods on the `Event` are patched.
 * 2. Event replay - the event is being dispatched by the framework once the handlers have been
 *    loaded (during hydration, or late-loaded). Certain `Event` properties can be unset by the
 *    browser because the `Event` is no longer actively being dispatched, such as `target`. Other
 *    methods have no effect because the `Event` has already been dispatched, such as
 *    `preventDefault`. Bubbling would also not work. These properties and methods are patched,
 *    either to fill in information that the browser may have removed, or to throw errors in methods
 *    that no longer behave as expected.

 * in the external deferred js, and instantiated and registered with
